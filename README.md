> **Note:** As I'm from the ENTC branch (which you allowed later), I got to know about this assignment format just a day before submission.  
> Hence, I have used **static data** for now. After submission, I will be working on **tags generation and vibe analysis for posts**.

-  **Database Integration** – Replace static JSON with MongoDB/PostgreSQL for persistent storage and queries.  
-  **AI-Powered Post Analysis** – Use OpenCV/TensorFlow/Gemini API for:  
  - Auto-tag generation from images  
  - Vibe/ambience classification (casual, aesthetic, luxury, etc.)  
  - Quality indicators (lighting, clarity, visual appeal)  
-  **Video/Reels Analysis** – Detect objects/events in reels (e.g., "beach", "dance", "food review") and classify ambience.  
-  **Audience Demographics Dashboard** – Infer and visualize gender split, age groups, and geographic distribution of audience.  
-  **Advanced Analytics** – Add deeper insights like engagement trends over time, content category distribution, and reach estimations.  
-  **Deployment** – Host the app on Vercel/Netlify for frontend and Render/Heroku for backend with connected database.
